# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
 - In this project, a light-weight pretrained model(MobileNet) from Tensorflow.keras is used
 - For real time implementation, the model has been used with OpenCV for prediction.
 ## System Pre Requisites
 - Visual Studio IDE with 'Desktop Development with C++' enabled (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
 - Cmak module installation as well (https://cmake.org/download/)
